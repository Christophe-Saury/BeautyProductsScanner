# BeautyProductsScanner


This is a school project in project management at ISEP. We had to develop a project from the determination phase of the subject to the design of the first version of the application serving as a proof of concept. The most crucial part of the project in the eyes of our professors was the creation of a report that includes the work done throughout the project, covering:
- an elevator pitch
- a user questionnaire
- an impact mapping
- personas
- user stories
- a story map
- a release plan
We also added to this report mockups from our application prototype on Figma.


**Identified Problem :**

The identified problem is the complexity and difficulty for users to find personal care products tailored to their specific needs in terms of beauty, skincare, hair, and beard care. The diversity of user needs and products on the market often makes this search tedious.


**Solution :**

Our project aims to simplify users' beauty routines by using an intelligent scanner to identify their current products and recommend personalized care tailored to their skin type, hair, and beard. With advanced search features, product evaluations, personalized advice, an integrated blog, and soon consultations with experts, we aim to provide a holistic experience to help users feel more confident and in control of their appearance and well-being.


**My Role :**

I contributed to :
- defining the problem
- defining a solution
- the elevator pitch
- the user questionnaire and interviews with potential users
- impact mapping
- personas
- the story map
- the release plan
- prototyping on Figma


**Figma Prototype :**

During the prototyping phase on this project, we focused more on UX and didn't worry too much about the UI of the app as it's purpose is to make a proof of concept. 
We focused on functionability for this proof of concept.  
You can see the figma mockups for the app on the following link :

**The app :**

The app was coded in Node.js using Nest.js, angular and tailwind css.
There's instructions on how to perform the installs in the readme's of both the front and back directories of the code directory of this repo.
